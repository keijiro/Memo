# Wishlist

This is a running list of equipment Iâ€™m considering adding to my setup.
More than just a wishlistâ€”itâ€™s a place to collect thoughts and document progress.

**Last updated: 2024/12/31**
So far, Iâ€™ve purchased the items in the exact order listed here: M4 Max MacBook Pro, 35mm lens, and the Stand Plus.
As I acquire new gear, Iâ€™ll remove it from this list.

## ðŸŽ¥ Camera Equipment

### Motorized Camera Sliders

Iâ€™m exploring options for introducing motorized camera motion into my workflow.

* **Option 1: Motorized Dollies (No Rails)**
  Considering compact solutions that donâ€™t require a rail systemâ€”essentially, small motorized platforms.
  [This Neewer model](https://neewer.com/collections/sliders/products/video-camera-supports-66600072) seems like a good starting point.

* **Option 2: Rail-Based Sliders**
  Slightly more involved setups using rails. Iâ€™m looking at compact and relatively affordable models like
  [this one from Toprig](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CKYN3VGN).

Since I have no prior experience with motorized sliders or dollies, Iâ€™m undecided on which route to take.
Leaning towards starting with a simpler, more affordable dolly to get a feel for the workflow.

**TODO:** Watch comparison/review videos and collect notes.

## ðŸŽ¹ Music Instruments

### General Thoughts

Recently Iâ€™ve been re-evaluating the **Roland MC-101**, and it has somewhat diminished my appetite for exploring new music gear.
Still, one instrument has caught my attention.

### Sonicware Liven Ambient Ã˜

I'm intrigued not so much by its use in music production, but by its potential as a **performance instrument**â€”particularly for live drone-based textures with hands-on real-time manipulation.

Iâ€™ve watched several demo videos, but itâ€™s hard to gauge the actual flexibility and depth for real-time performance.
As a groovebox, itâ€™s certainly on the affordable side, so I might just pick one up and experiment directly.

Iâ€™m also interested in how it could be **integrated with visuals**. Since it appears to send all basic parameters as MIDI CCs, thereâ€™s a possibility of using that data to drive or manipulate visuals in real time.
